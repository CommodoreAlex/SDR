# Introduction to SDR

Software Defined Radio (SDR) is a revolutionary approach to radio communication that replaces traditional hardware-based components with software-driven processing. This enables users to tune into various signals, analyze waveforms, and even experiment with wireless communications dynamically.

## What is SDR?

Software Defined Radio refers to a system where radio functionalities such as modulation, demodulation, filtering, and signal processing are handled through software rather than dedicated hardware components. This allows for greater flexibility, making SDR an essential tool in research, education, and practical applications like signal intelligence, amateur radio, and wireless security.

### Advantages of SDR:

- **Flexibility** – Modify and update radio parameters without changing hardware.
- **Wide Frequency Range** – Access multiple bands using a single device.
- **Cost-Effective** – Eliminates the need for multiple radios for different frequencies.
- **Research and Experimentation** – Enables deep analysis of signals, learning about modulation techniques, and more.

## Understanding Frequency Bands and Modulation

Wireless communication relies on different frequency bands and modulation techniques to transmit and receive data effectively.

### Frequency Bands

A **frequency band** is a specific range of frequencies allocated for different types of communication, including broadcast radio, television, cellular networks, aviation, satellite, and military operations.

**Common Frequency Bands:**
- **AM Radio**: 535 kHz – 1.7 MHz
- **FM Radio**: 88 MHz – 108 MHz
- **VHF Aviation Band**: 118 MHz – 137 MHz
- **UHF Public Safety Band**: 450 MHz – 512 MHz
- **Wi-Fi**: 2.4 GHz & 5 GHz

### Modulation Techniques

Modulation is the process of encoding information onto a carrier wave for transmission. The most common types of modulation include:
- **Amplitude Modulation (AM)** – Varies the amplitude of the carrier wave.
- **Frequency Modulation (FM)** – Varies the frequency of the carrier wave.
- **Phase Modulation (PM)** – Varies the phase of the carrier wave.
- **Digital Modulation** – Used in modern communications (QAM, PSK, FSK).

## Understanding Decibels and Signal Strength

### What are Decibels (dB)?

A **decibel (dB)** is a logarithmic unit used to measure signal strength, power, and loss in communication systems. It helps describe the ratio between two values, such as signal power or voltage.

**Key Decibel Concepts:**

- **dBm (Decibels relative to 1mW)** – Measures absolute power levels.
- **dBμV (Decibels relative to 1 microvolt)** – Measures signal strength in RF circuits.
- **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)** – The difference in dB between a signal and background noise.

### Signal Strength and Noise

- **Stronger signals** have higher dBm values (e.g., -30 dBm is stronger than -80 dBm).
- **Noise floor** represents the ambient electromagnetic noise in an environment.
- **Dynamic range** determines how well an SDR can differentiate between strong and weak signals.

By understanding these fundamentals, SDR users can analyze signals, optimize antenna setups, and improve reception quality.
