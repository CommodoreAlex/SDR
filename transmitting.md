# Transmitting (Where Legally Permitted)

## Overview

In this section, we explore the fundamentals of SDR-based transmission, including the legal and regulatory considerations. While RTL-SDR devices are primarily designed for reception, other SDR hardware like HackRF and LimeSDR support transmission. Understanding the principles of transmission is crucial for anyone looking to legally and responsibly experiment with SDR-based communication.

## Basics of SDR-Based Transmission

### Understanding Transmission

Software-defined radios that support transmission can generate and modulate signals on various frequencies. Unlike traditional radio transmitters, SDRs provide flexibility by allowing users to define transmission parameters programmatically.

### Required Hardware for Transmission

To transmit signals, you will need an SDR capable of transmission. Some popular options include:
- **HackRF One** – A half-duplex SDR capable of both transmitting and receiving.
- **LimeSDR** – A full-duplex SDR with wideband capabilities.
- **BladeRF** – An SDR with strong performance for both reception and transmission.

### Software for SDR Transmission

There are various software tools available for configuring and controlling SDR-based transmission:
- **GNU Radio** – A powerful framework for developing SDR applications.
- **SDR Angel** – A multi-platform SDR program supporting both reception and transmission.
- **GQRX (with transmit-enabled SDRs)** – Useful for basic SDR functionality, including transmitting.
- **Universal Radio Hacker (URH)** – A tool for analyzing and replaying wireless signals.

## Licensing Requirements and Regulations

### Understanding Legal Implications

Transmitting radio signals without proper authorization is illegal in most countries. It is essential to understand and comply with regulations set by governing bodies like the **FCC (Federal Communications Commission)** in the U.S. or similar agencies worldwide.

### Steps to Ensure Legal Transmission

1. **Obtain the Necessary License** – Depending on the frequency and transmission power, you may need an **Amateur Radio License** or a **Special Use License**.
2. **Operate Within Approved Frequencies** – Only transmit on bands where you have permission.
3. **Use Proper Power Levels** – High-power transmissions without authorization can interfere with critical communication systems.
4. **Avoid Restricted and Emergency Frequencies** – Unauthorized use of emergency or restricted bands is a serious offense.

## Using HackRF / LimeSDR for Transmission Experiments:

### Setting Up a Basic Transmission for LICENSED individuals:

Once you have **legal permission** to transmit, follow these steps to begin experimenting with SDR-based transmission:

1. **Connect your SDR Device** – Ensure that your HackRF or LimeSDR is properly installed and recognized by your system.
2. **Select the Appropriate Software** – Use tools like GNU Radio or SDR Angel for signal generation.
3. **Choose a Frequency and Modulation** – Define parameters such as frequency, bandwidth, and modulation type (AM/FM/PSK).
4. **Generate and Transmit the Signal** – Use your software to create and send a test transmission.

### Example: Transmitting an FM Signal with GNU Radio

1. Open **GNU Radio Companion (GRC)**.
2. Create a **Signal Source** and set the waveform (sine/square/etc.).
3. Connect the signal to an **FM Modulator** block.
4. Link the output to the **SDR Sink** (HackRF/LimeSDR).
5. Set the transmission frequency and power level within legal limits.
6. Start the flowgraph and monitor the signal with another SDR receiver.
