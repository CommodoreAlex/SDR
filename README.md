### Project Overview

This repository provides resources, guides, and experiments using **Software Defined Radios (SDR)** such as **RTL-SDR** and software tools like **SDR# (SDR Sharp)** to explore and understand wireless communications.

 **Other learning objectives include:**
- Learn the fundamentals of Software Defined Radios
- Understand signal processing concepts
- Work with hardware like RTL-SDR to receive and decode signals
- Use software tools like SDR Sharp, GNU Radio, and other SDR applications
- Conduct hands-on experiments with real-world wireless signals
- Document findings and share knowledge with others

---
### Legal & Ethical Considerations

- Always adhere to local laws and regulations when working with SDR.
- Do not transmit on restricted frequencies without authorization.
- Respect privacy and ethical considerations when decoding signals.
